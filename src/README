 Implements redifsh APIs using bottle for Board Management Controller using
 Dbus interface for querying, and performing tasks.
 This code must comply to pep8 and redfish standards
 Redfish uses HTTP operations including GET, PUT, PATCH, POST, DELETE, HEAD.
 GET retrieves data.  POST is used for creating resources or to use actions.
 DELETE will delete a resource, but there are currently only a few resources
 that can be deleted.  PATCH is used to change one or more
 properties on a resource, while PUT is used to replace a resource entirely
 (though only a few resources can be completely replaced).  HEAD is similar to
 GET without the body data returned, and can be used for figuring out the URI
 structure by programs accessing a Redfish implementation.
